## Building
To build the game, you need to have Processing 4 installed. You can download it [here](https://processing.org/download/).

After installing Processing, you have to install the **Sound** library.
You can do this by going to `Sketch > Import Library... > Manage Libraries...` and searching for `Sound`.
Then finally, install the library by clicking the `Install` button.

You can then open the `DWM_WARLOCK.pde` file in Processing and run the game by clicking the play button.
